          <h2>2007 - First Met</h2>
          <p>
            Introduced to one another thanks to our mutual friend Angela. Phil
            had met Angela whilst playing an online strategy game called Utopia
            where he started talking to her.

          <h2>2008 - First Knew How I Felt (Phil)</h2>
          <p>
            Phil first developed feelings towards Becca after getting to know
            her through playing Utopia and talking on MSN Messenger. Didn't do
            much or say anything about these feelings due to age and distance
            and no way to get to Canada.

          <h2>2022 - Decemeber - The Month that changed everything.</h2>
          <p>
            At the start of the month during one of our random catch ups, i took
            it apon me to finally let Becca know how i felt about her. It was
            from there when we looked over previous messages and talked a lot
            about it and the realisation started to come into Becca's head, that
            i had been in front of her all this time and she hadn't a clue until
            now.

          <p>
            Spent most of my Birthday flying on planes from the UK to Canada,
            but it was well worth it as it was the first time i got to actually
            see Becca in person (despite many video calls by this time) and it
            cemeted everything that had happened over the past month and a half.

          <h2>2023 - January - The Engagement Ring.</h2>
          <p>
            I Purchased the engagement ring from whilst in the UK and we picked it up on 
            the 25th Jan, we had already discussed getting engaged and our future 
            together whilst i was back in the UK as we had known each other for so long it was not a difficult set of topics to get into.
            Picking out the ring was interesting, we video called, Becca found the ring she really wanted and 
            i purchased it via email and phone calls with the Assistant 
            Manager at the jewellers who funny enough was British also.

          <h2>2023 - Febuary - The Proposal</h2>
          <p>
            Since collecting the ring on the 25th January, i have been holding on to it waiting for the right
            moment, I had worked out a plan with our mutual friend Angela, where we would be visiting them in Halifax,
            we would take a trip to the beach near them and i would be doing an IRL stream on twitch, i would then hand the 
            phone and stream to Angela which she would know was her signal to distract Becca whilst i got down on one knee behind her
            and call her name getting her to turn around and see me proposing to her live on stream.
            Unfortunately illness and weather hampered us getting down there for the specific dates we wanted to be ther for, 
            so in the end i surprised Becca at home one night, being down on one knee when she came back into the bedroom after dealing
            with one of the boys where i told her how much i loved her along with a little speach about they 16 years of knowning her.

            If you hadn't of guessed already She Said Yes!!!!
