                        <p>Phil first developed feelings towards Becca after getting to know her through playing Utopia and talking on MSN Messenger. Didn't do much or say anything about these feelings due to age and distance and no way to get to Canada.</p>

                        <p>At the start of the month during one of our random catch ups, i took it apon me to finally let Becca know how i felt about her. It was from there when we looked over previous messages and talked a lot about it and the realisation started to come into Becca's head, that i had been in front of her all this time and she hadn't a clue until now.</p>

                        <p>Spent most of my Birthday flying on planes from the UK to Canada, but it was well worth it as it was the first time i got to actually see Becca in person (despite many video calls by this time) and it cemeted everything that had happened over the past month and a half.</p>
